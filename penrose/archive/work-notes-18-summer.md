## TODOs

- Pending:
    - [ ] Dynamic parsing: read https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DPpAvBKGnr96MyohJAj2M40zrppjPV7sbd25Nz-qfkg/edit
    - [ ] Open GitHub issue about structural editor
- Now
	- [ ] reproduce surjection
		- [ ] add random generator into computation
	- [ ] rewrite arrow rendering
		- [ ] make arrow heads look better
	- [ ] start porting linear algebra

	- [ ] start implementing RA
	- [ ] look into: Resampling seems to always do nothing on the first step
